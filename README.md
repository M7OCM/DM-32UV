# DM-32UV
Baofeng firmware for the DM-32UV DMR radio (known as the Taiwan version), different chip and hardware. Firmware always begins with 00.00. or 00.01, note the first two digits 00. also early examples used the firmware prefix "UV" instead of "DM" just to confuse the shit out of everyone! If installed on the wrong hardware it will soft brick the radio, solution is to remove battery, turn device on while pressing SK1 and PTT and reflash the correct version.

Reset radio by first uploading a CPS file with allow reset selected and turn on while holding SK1 and SK2, the reset menu can then be initialised.

**Additional information gleaned from ChatGPT:**

The Baofeng DM-32 DMR radio has two distinct versions, with the earlier, less common variant featuring the HR-C6000 vocoder chipset. This version is believed to have been developed in collaboration with a Taiwanese partner and is sometimes referred to as the "Taiwan version."

It is characterized by unique firmware and hardware differences compared to the more widely available model.

**Key Characteristics of the Early HR Vocoder Version.**

HR-C6000 Vocoder: This chipset was used in several early DMR radios, including the Radioddity GD-77 and Baofeng DM-1801. Its presence in the early DM-32 suggests shared design elements with these models.

**Firmware Availability and Legal Considerations**

Due to licensing restrictions surrounding the HR-C6000 vocoder, firmware for this version is not widely distributed. The vocoder's intellectual property is owned by DVSI, and unauthorized distribution of firmware containing this technology can lead to legal issues. As a result, many communities and developers avoid sharing such firmware publicly.
