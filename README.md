# DM-32UV
Baofeng firmware for the DM-32UV DMR radio (known as the Taiwan version), different chip and hardware. Firmware always begins with 00.00. or 00.01, note the first two digits 00. also early examples used the firmware prefix "UV" instead of "DM" just to confuse the shit out of everyone! If installed on the wrong hardware it will soft brick the radio, solution is to remove battery, turn device on while pressing SK1 and PTT and reflash the correct version.

Reset radio by first uploading a CPS file with allow reset selected and turn on while holding SK1 and SK2, the reset menu can then be initialised.
