# DM-32UV
Archive of Baofeng CPS, firmware and software for the Baofeng DM-32UV DMR radio.

It should be noted that the CPS is extremely buggy, even the latest, and the various firmware revisions are too, some features do not work but most do on 0.46. They are provided here purely as a one stop archive. The validity of the content is for the most part unknown. There are many firmware versions I have not discovered and I am interested in hearing from anyone that can share early test firmware or CPS not listed herein.

Despite these shortcomings the radio is actually pretty solid but be prepared to spend some time figuring out basic stuff let alone the more complex things - good luck.

Many thanks to RA4FHE for his research, experimentation and knowledge!
